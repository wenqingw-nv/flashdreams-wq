"""Grad-friendly functional self-attention for corrector training (Omnidreams).

The production ``SelfAttention.forward`` routes the current chunk's K / V
through the rolling ``BlockKVCache`` (in-place write into a no-grad buffer,
then a buffer read), which severs gradients into the ``k_proj`` / ``v_proj``
projections; the fused RoPE Triton kernel is likewise inference-only (raw
stores, no backward).

The functional variant below computes Q / K / V directly (differentiable
non-interleaved RoPE), reads the *history prefix* from the cache buffer
(no grad -- replayed history is frozen in v1), and runs attention over
``[prefix, current]`` without writing the cache. For a single probe forward
per ``start`` / ``finalize`` bracket this is mathematically identical to the
stock path. Deployment keeps the stock path; the weights are shared.

The patch is a *toggle*, not a wholesale swap: history-replay forwards
(``finalize_kv_cache``) must keep the stock cache-writing path, so probes
run inside ``functional_attention()`` and everything else stays stock.

Mirrors :class:`omnidreams.transformer.impl.modules.SelfAttention` and the
``rope_kernel`` semantics (cos/sin in fp32, cast to ``x.dtype`` before the
multiply); revisit on upstream changes.
