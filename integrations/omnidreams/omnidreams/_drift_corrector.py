"""Clean Forcing drift corrector for the Omnidreams runner.

Deploys the trained corrector LoRA (``drift_correction/train_v2.py``
checkpoints) on a built :class:`~omnidreams.runner.OmnidreamsRunner`'s
pipeline at ``alpha*(t) * gain`` per denoise step. SHIPPED config (owner
decision 2026-07-24): ``lora_v2_v3_valpeak.pt`` at gain 0.25
(``corrgate025`` — best trees/foliage detail and consistency, drift
Delta +0.99 vs base +2.44). Mirrors the HY-WorldPlay deploy module
(``hy_worldplay/_drift_corrector.py``); self-contained so the production
runner does not import the research directory.

By default the LoRA is **pre-merged**: at load time each discrete
``alpha*(t) * gain`` value gets its own cached copy of the target
projection weights with the scaled delta folded in, and the per-step gate
just swaps the cached set in — zero extra work in the hot path. The gate
is driven CPU-side from the load-time solver schedule (one
``predict_flow`` call per solver step), so the corrected forward issues
the same kernels as base with no GPU timestep readback. Set
``DRIFT_CORRECTOR_UNFUSED=1`` to fall back to the runtime A/B-matmul path
(the pre-2026-07-25 behavior).
